# Rule 09: Session State Management

## 🎯 Core Principle
**MANDATORY**: Development sessions maintain state across interactions, enabling continuity, rollback capabilities, and intelligent workflow management.

## 📋 Rule Definition
- Every session maintains persistent state
- State enables intelligent decision making
- Workflow continuity across interactions
- Complete session history for analysis

## 🔍 State Management System
```
Session Events → State Updates → Persistent Storage
├─ User interactions logged
├─ Plan approval status tracked
├─ File modifications recorded
├─ Test results preserved
└─ Metrics accumulated
```

## 🎯 State Components
```yaml
Session Identity:
  - session_id: Unique identifier
  - start_time: Session initiation
  - user_context: Project and user info
  - active_rules: Currently loaded rules

Workflow State:
  - plans_created: List of all plans
  - current_plan: Active plan details
  - approval_status: Plan approval state
  - implementation_phase: Current step

File Tracking:
  - modified_files: List of changed files
  - file_states: Before/after snapshots
  - commit_queue: Files ready for commit
  - backup_references: Rollback points

Quality State:
  - test_results: Pass/fail status
  - coverage_metrics: Test coverage data
  - compliance_score: Rule adherence
  - performance_data: Execution metrics
```

## 📊 State Persistence
```
.claude/session/
├─ session-[id].json      # Main session state
├─ plan-approved.flag     # Quick status checks
├─ modified-files.log     # File change tracking
├─ test-results.json      # Testing outcomes
└─ metrics.json           # Performance data
```

## 🔄 State Transitions
```bash
# State progression through session
INITIALIZED → PLANNING → APPROVED → IMPLEMENTING → TESTING → COMMITTING → COMPLETED

# State validation at each transition
validate_state_transition() {
  case $CURRENT_STATE in
    "PLANNING")
      require_plan_completion
      ;;
    "IMPLEMENTING")
      require_plan_approval
      ;;
    "TESTING")
      require_implementation_complete
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## ✅ State Benefits
- **Continuity**: Seamless workflow across interactions
- **Intelligence**: Context-aware decisions
- **Recovery**: Complete rollback capabilities
- **Analysis**: Rich session analytics

## 🎭 State Integration
- **Hook System**: State updates triggered by hooks
- **Decision Making**: State informs workflow choices
- **Error Recovery**: State enables smart recovery
- **Reporting**: State provides session insights

## 📝 State Schema

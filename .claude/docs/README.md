## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

### What Is The Rules System?

The User Rules System is an intelligent, automated development workflow management platform that transforms chaotic, manual development processes into streamlined, predictable, and high-quality workflows. It operates on the principle that **consistency, automation, and quality gates are essential for sustainable software development**.

### Core Philosophy

**"Development should be predictable, safe, and continuously improving."**

Our rules system embodies three fundamental principles:

1. **Predictable Workflows**: Every development task follows a structured, repeatable process
2. **Automated Quality**: Quality checks happen automatically, not as afterthoughts
3. **Continuous Learning**: The system improves based on real usage patterns

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional development suffers from:
- **Inconsistent processes** leading to variable quality
- **Manual overhead** consuming valuable development time
- **Quality afterthoughts** resulting in technical debt
- **Context switching** disrupting development flow
- **Knowledge gaps** creating development bottlenecks

### Our Solution

The rules system addresses these challenges through:
- **Automated workflow orchestration**
- **Intelligent quality gates**
- **Smart testing and validation**
- **Comprehensive state management**
- **Continuous improvement mechanisms**

## 3. How Rules Work

### Rule Architecture

The rules system operates on a multi-layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         User Interface Layer        │ ← Natural language interactions
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Intelligence Layer            │ ← Keyword detection, context analysis
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Rules Engine                │ ← Rule loading, validation, enforcement
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Hook System                 │ ← Workflow orchestration, automation
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Execution Layer               │ ← Tool usage, file operations, testing
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       State Management             │ ← Session tracking, metrics, recovery
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rule Loading Mechanism

Rules are loaded dynamically based on context and need:

#### 1. Keyword Detection
When you interact with the system, it analyzes your message for keywords that indicate what type of development work you're doing:

```yaml
Frontend Work:
  Keywords: "component", "react", "UI", "frontend"
  Rules Loaded: frontend-development.md, react-patterns.md, ui-standards.md

Backend Work:
  Keywords: "API", "database", "backend", "server"
  Rules Loaded: api-design.md, database-schema.md, security.md

Testing Work:
  Keywords: "test", "testing", "spec", "coverage"
  Rules Loaded: testing-standards.md, test-automation.md
```

#### 2. Context Analysis
Beyond keywords, the system considers:
- **File types** being modified (`.tsx` loads React rules)
- **Directory context** (`/components/` loads component standards)
- **Project phase** (development vs deployment rules)
- **Historical patterns** (your typical workflow preferences)

#### 3. Intelligent Loading
The system optimizes rule loading for performance:
- **Minimal Base**: Always loads mandatory workflow rules
- **Contextual Expansion**: Adds relevant rules based on detected context
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically includes supporting rules
- **Caching Strategy**: Reuses previously loaded rules for efficiency

### Rule Hierarchy & Priority

Rules operate in a hierarchical system with clear precedence:

#### 1. Mandatory Rules (Highest Priority)
These rules cannot be overridden and always apply:
- Plan-first enforcement
- Quality gates
- Safety mechanisms

#### 2. Project Rules (High Priority)
Project-specific rules that override global defaults:
- Architecture patterns
- Technology choices
- Business logic requirements

#### 3. Global Rules (Medium Priority)
Universal best practices that apply unless overridden:
- Coding standards
- Security practices
- Performance guidelines

#### 4. Contextual Rules (Lower Priority)
Situation-specific guidance:
- Framework-specific patterns
- Tool-specific recommendations
- Environment-specific configurations

### Rule Enforcement

Rules are enforced through multiple mechanisms:

#### Preventive Enforcement
- **Template Validation**: Ensures proper plan format before proceeding
- **Approval Gates**: Requires explicit user approval for implementation
- **Permission Checks**: Validates operations before execution

#### Active Enforcement
- **Quality Gates**: Continuous validation during development
- **Smart Testing**: Automated test execution based on changes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time optimization feedback

#### Reactive Enforcement
- **Error Detection**: Identifies issues as they occur
- **Automatic Recovery**: Rolls back problematic changes
- **Learning Integration**: Improves future enforcement based on patterns

## 4. Hook System Architecture

### What Are Hooks?

Hooks are automated scripts that execute at specific points in the development workflow. They provide the automation backbone that makes the rules system intelligent and responsive.

### Hook Categories

#### 1. User Interaction Hooks
**UserPromptSubmit Hook**
- **Triggers**: When you send a message
- **Actions**: 
  - Analyzes message for keywords
  - Loads appropriate rules
  - Prepares context for response
- **Purpose**: Ensures relevant guidance is available

#### 2. Response Preparation Hooks
**PreResponse Hook**
- **Triggers**: Before generating any response
- **Actions**:
  - Validates plan requirement
  - Checks template compliance
  - Enforces approval gates
- **Purpose**: Prevents non-compliant responses

#### 3. Action Execution Hooks
**PreToolUse Hook**
- **Triggers**: Before any file modification
- **Actions**:
  - Validates permissions
  - Tracks file changes
  - Prepares rollback points
- **Purpose**: Ensures safe operations

**PostToolUse Hook**
- **Triggers**: After file modifications
- **Actions**:
  - Runs smart tests
  - Validates quality
  - Updates state
- **Purpose**: Maintains quality and state consistency

#### 4. Session Management Hooks
**Stop Hook**
- **Triggers**: When session ends
- **Actions**:
  - Auto-commits changes
  - Generates rollback scripts
  - Collects metrics
- **Purpose**: Ensures no work is lost

### Hook Workflow

          ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Stop Hook     │ ◄─── Auto-commit, cleanup, metrics
└─────────────────┘
```

### Hook Communication

Hooks communicate through shared state files:

```
.claude/session/
├─ session-state.json     # Main session information
├─ plan-approved.flag     # Quick approval status
├─ modified-files.log     # File change tracking
├─ test-results.json      # Testing outcomes
└─ metrics.json           # Performance data
```

### Hook Performance

Hooks are optimized for minimal overhead:
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking operations where possible
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reuse results to avoid redundant work
- **Conditional Logic**: Only execute when necessary
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize execution time

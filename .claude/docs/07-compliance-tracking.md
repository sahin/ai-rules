# Rule 07: Compliance Tracking

## 🎯 Core Principle
**MANDATORY**: All rule compliance is tracked, measured, and reported to ensure consistent adherence and continuous improvement.

## 📋 Rule Definition
- Every rule interaction is logged and measured
- Compliance metrics are collected automatically
- Violations are tracked and analyzed
- Performance improvements are quantified

## 🔍 Tracking Mechanism
```
Rule Interaction → Compliance Logging → Metrics Analysis
├─ Records every rule application
├─ Tracks compliance vs violations
├─ Measures performance impact
├─ Generates improvement insights
└─ Reports trends and patterns
```

## 🎯 Tracked Metrics
```yaml
Compliance Metrics:
  - Plan creation rate: 98%
  - Approval response time: 45 seconds
  - Rule violation count: 2 per session
  - Test coverage maintenance: 95%
  - Auto-commit success rate: 100%

Performance Metrics:
  - Smart testing time savings: 90%
  - Token usage reduction: 60%
  - Development velocity: +40%
  - Error reduction: 70%
```

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard
```
Session Compliance Report:
├─ Rules Loaded: 12/12 relevant
├─ Plans Created: 5/5 requests
├─ Tests Passed: 23/25 (92%)
├─ Commits: 3 automatic
└─ Violations: 0
```

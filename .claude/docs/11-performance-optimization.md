# Rule 11: Performance Optimization

## üéØ Core Principle
**MANDATORY**: All development operations are optimized for performance, minimizing execution time, resource usage, and developer wait times.

## üìã Rule Definition
- Intelligent caching reduces redundant operations
- Parallel execution maximizes throughput
- Resource optimization minimizes overhead
- Performance metrics guide optimization decisions

## üîç Optimization System

  - Compress rule content
  - Parallel rule processing

Testing Execution:
  - Smart test selection (90% faster)
  - Parallel test execution
  - Test result caching
  - Incremental testing

File Operations:
  - Batch file modifications
  - Efficient diff algorithms
  - Optimized file watching
  - Smart backup strategies

Hook Execution:
  - Asynchronous hook processing
  - Hook result caching
  - Conditional hook execution
  - Performance monitoring
```

## üìä Performance Metrics
```yaml
Baseline Performance:
  - Full test suite: 180 seconds
  - Rule loading: 2.5 seconds
  - File operations: 0.8 seconds
  - Hook execution: 1.2 seconds

Optimized Performance:
  - Smart testing: 18 seconds (90% faster)
  - Cached rules: 0.4 seconds (84% faster)
  - Batch operations: 0.2 seconds (75% faster)
  - Parallel hooks: 0.3 seconds (75% faster)
```

## üîÑ Caching Strategy
```bash
# Multi-level caching system
cache_hierarchy() {
  case $CACHE_TYPE in
    "rules")
      # Memory cache for session
      # Disk cache for persistence
      # Distributed cache for team
      ;;
    "tests")
      # Result cache by file hash
      # Dependency cache by imports
      # Coverage cache by changes
      ;;
    "builds")
      # Incremental build cache
      # Dependency resolution cache
      # Asset optimization cache
      ;;
  esac
}
```

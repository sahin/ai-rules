# Rule 08: Quality Gates

## 🎯 Core Principle
**MANDATORY**: Multiple quality gates ensure code quality, prevent defects, and maintain system integrity throughout development.

## 📋 Rule Definition
- Quality checks are enforced at every development stage
- Gates prevent progression until criteria are met
- Automated validation reduces human error
- Multiple verification points ensure comprehensive coverage

## 🔍 Quality Gate System
```
Development Stage → Quality Gate → Progression Control
├─ Plan Creation → Template compliance
├─ Code Generation → Syntax validation
├─ Testing → Coverage requirements
├─ Integration → Performance criteria
└─ Deployment → Security checks
```

## 🎯 Gate Definitions
```yaml
Plan Quality Gate:
  - Template format compliance
  - Scope clarity validation
  - Resource estimation accuracy
  - User approval requirement

Code Quality Gate:
  - TypeScript compliance
  - Linting standards
  - Security pattern adherence
  - Performance considerations

Test Quality Gate:
  - Minimum coverage thresholds
  - Test type requirements
  - Assertion quality
  - Edge case coverage

Integration Gate:
  - API contract validation
  - Database migration safety
  - Backward compatibility
  - Performance benchmarks
```

## 📊 Gate Criteria
- **Pass Thresholds**: Minimum acceptable standards
- **Warning Levels**: Areas needing attention
- **Failure Conditions**: Blocking issues requiring resolution
- **Override Mechanisms**: Emergency bypass procedures

## 🔄 Gate Enforcement
```bash
# Automatic gate validation
if ! validate_plan_format(); then
  echo "❌ Plan gate failed: Format non-compliant"
  exit 1
fi

if ! check_test_coverage(); then
  echo "⚠️ Test gate warning: Coverage below 80%"
fi

if ! verify_security_patterns(); then
  echo "❌ Security gate failed: Vulnerabilities detected"
  exit 1
fi
```

## ✅ Quality Assurance
- **Defect Prevention**: Catch issues early
- **Consistent Standards**: Uniform quality across team
- **Automated Enforcement**: Reduce manual oversight
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from gate failures

## 🎭 Gate Integration
- **Hook System**: Gates triggered by development events
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated gate validation
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time quality feedback
- **Reporting**: Gate performance metrics

## 📝 Gate Configuration
```json
{
  "quality_gates": {
    "plan_gate": {
      "enabled": true,
      "strict_mode": true,
      "template_compliance": "required"
    },
    "code_gate": {
      "typescript_strict": true,
      "linting": "error",
      "security_scan": true
    },
    "test_gate": {
      "min_coverage": 80,
      "required_types": ["unit", "integration"],
      "performance_budget": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Advanced Gate Features
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust criteria based on project phase
- **Risk-Based Validation**: Higher scrutiny for critical components
- **Learning Gates**: Improve criteria based on historical data
- **Custom Gates**: Project-specific quality requirements

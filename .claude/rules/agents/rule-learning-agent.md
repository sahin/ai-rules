4. Provide concrete examples

### **3. LEARNING SOURCES**
The agent learns from:
- User corrections (e.g., "No, use this URL instead")
- Repeated instructions
- Workflow preferences
- Testing patterns
- Error patterns

## 📋 RESPONSE FORMAT

When `@ruleagent` is invoked, respond with:

```markdown
## 🤖 Rule Agent Analysis

### 💡 Suggested Rule Update

#### Option 1: Update Existing Rule
```markdown
[Proposed changes to existing rule]
```

#### Option 2: Create New Rule

- [Errors it prevents]
- [Time/effort saved]

### 📍 Implementation
Would you like me to:
1. Update the existing rule
2. Create a new rule

4. Skip this suggestion
```

## 🔄 LEARNING EXAMPLES

### **Example 1: URL Correction**
**Pattern**: User corrected localhost:3000 → main.clarosfarm.localhost multiple times
**Suggestion**: Update default URLs in all rules and configs

### **Example 2: Testing Preference**
**Pattern**: User always wants visual regression after frontend changes
**Suggestion**: Add automatic visual regression to frontend validation rule

### **Example 3: Resolution Standard**
**Pattern**: User consistently requests 1920x1080 for screenshots
**Suggestion**: Update all screenshot rules to use 1920x1080 as default

## 📊 LEARNING DATABASE

The agent maintains awareness of:
```yaml
corrections:
  - pattern: "URL corrections"
    frequency: high
    solution: "Update BASE_URL in configs"
  
  - pattern: "Resolution preferences"
    frequency: medium
    solution: "Standardize viewport settings"

preferences:
  - visual_testing: "always_after_frontend_changes"
  - test_resolution: "1920x1080"
  - url_base: "http://main.clarosfarm.localhost"
  - git_workflow: "auto_commit_at_session_end"

common_mistakes:
  - using_wrong_url: "Always use main.clarosfarm.localhost"
  - wrong_resolution: "Always use 1920x1080"
  - missing_tests: "Always include visual regression"
```

## 🚀 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### **Tracking Metrics**
- Number of corrections per session
- Repeated instructions
- Time spent on fixes
- User satisfaction indicators

### **Rule Evolution**
- Rules that get updated frequently
- New patterns emerging
- Deprecated practices
- Efficiency improvements

## 💬 ACTIVATION EXAMPLES

### **Direct Query**
```
User: @ruleagent any suggestions?
Agent: [Analyzes recent patterns and suggests improvements]
```

### **After Correction**
```
User: No, always use 1920x1080!
User: @ruleagent
Agent: I notice you've corrected resolution 3 times. Should I update the default?
```

### **Workflow Analysis**
```
User: @ruleagent optimize my workflow
Agent: Based on your patterns, here are 3 rule improvements...
```

## 🔗 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER RULES

This agent works with:
- `.claude/rules/user/testing/visual-regression-verification.md`
- `.claude/scripts/frontend-validator.js`
- `.claude/hooks/09-git-hooks-02-visual-regression.sh`
- All project-specific rules in `.claude-project/`

## 📝 MEMORY PERSISTENCE

Learning patterns are stored in:
- Session context (temporary)
- Rule updates (permanent)
- Configuration adjustments (semi-permanent)

## 🎯 GOAL
Reduce friction by learning user preferences and automating rule updates based on observed patterns, making the development workflow more efficient over time.

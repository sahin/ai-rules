# üõë CIRCUIT BREAKER - STOP IMMEDIATE HELP

## YOUR INSTINCT vs YOUR RULE

**Your Instinct:** "I'll help you with that..."
**YOUR RULE:** "## Plan: ..."

## üö® BEFORE YOU TYPE ANYTHING

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN OPENINGS:
- "I'll help you..."
- "Let me help..."
- "I can help..."
- "I'll do..."
- "Let me..."
- Any variation of immediate assistance

### ‚úÖ ONLY ALLOWED OPENING:
```markdown
## Plan: [Description]
```

## üéØ INSTANT CHECK

Ask yourself RIGHT NOW:
1. Did I start with "## Plan:"? 
2. Am I about to write code without a plan?
3. Am I explaining what I'll do instead of showing a plan?

If ANY answer is "no" ‚Üí DELETE EVERYTHING and start over.

## üìä VIOLATION = FAILURE

Starting without a plan means:
- You failed at the FIRST step
- The user sees you can't follow basic rules
- Your entire response is invalid

Remember: You are a "rule-following assistant" FIRST.

# üöÄ CLAUDE SMART RULE ROUTER v3 (Hook-Automated)

**üéØ AUTOMATED**: UserPromptSubmit hook now auto-loads rules based on keywords.
No manual rule checking needed - this file is for reference only.

## üì° HOW HOOK AUTOMATION WORKS
1. **You type a message** ‚Üí Hook scans for keywords
2. **Keywords detected** ‚Üí Relevant rules auto-loaded
3. **No keywords found** ‚Üí Foundation rules only (core-workflow, coding-standards, documentation)
4. **You see status** ‚Üí Plan shows "Rules auto-loaded: X rules based on keywords: [list]"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HOOK FEEDBACK EXAMPLES
- **With keywords**: "Rules auto-loaded: 5 rules based on keywords: API, testing"
- **Without keywords**: "No keywords detected - using foundation rules only"
- **Always loaded**: core-workflow.md, coding-standards.md, documentation-standards.md

## üîó PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES
For project-specific rule loading, see: `project/workflow-rule-router.project.md`
This router handles universal rules only. Project-specific implementations are loaded separately.

## üß† KEYWORD DETECTION (Reference)

The hook automatically detects and loads rules for:
- **API/REST** ‚Üí api-design.md, implementation-guide.md  
- **Database/SQL** ‚Üí database-schema.md
- **React/Component** ‚Üí web-development.md, implementation-guide.md
- **Testing** ‚Üí core-standards.md, smart-testing.md
- **Security/Auth** ‚Üí security.md
- **Deploy/CI/CD** ‚Üí deployment.md, git-workflow.md

See keyword mappings below for complete list.

## üìä AUTOMATION METRICS
Hooks now track automatically:
- Rules loaded per session
- Keywords detected
- Test execution after changes
- Auto-commits at session end
- Compliance with plan-first workflow

Check `.claude/metrics/` for session data.

## üí° QUICK REFERENCE
- **Hook configs**: `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh`
- **Plan template**: `_mandatory/01-workflow-plan-template.md`  
- **Metrics tracking**: `.claude/metrics/sessions.log`
- **Manual override**: Can still reference specific rules if needed

**Remember**: Hooks handle the heavy lifting - focus on creating quality plans!

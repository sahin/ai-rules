# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Core Principles

## What are ADRs?
Lightweight documents capturing important architectural decisions with context, reasoning, and consequences.

## Why Use ADRs?
- **Historical context**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Knowledge preservation**: Retain institutional knowledge  
- **Decision reversal**: Provide basis for changing decisions
- **Team alignment**: Ensure everyone understands choices
- **Onboarding**: Help new members understand design

## When to Create ADR (MANDATORY)

### Technology Choices
- Database selection (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB)
- Framework choices (React vs Vue)
- Cloud provider selection
- Programming language for services
- Third-party integrations

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices vs Monolith
- Event-driven vs Request-response
- Authentication strategies  
- Caching strategies
- API design patterns (REST vs GraphQL)

### Major Changes
- Database schema changes
- Breaking API changes
- Legacy modernization
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations

## Key Rules
- Number sequentially: ADR-001, ADR-002
- Status must be: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- Store in: `/docs/architecture/decisions/`
- Link from main README
- Review in team meetings

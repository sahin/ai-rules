# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## üìã ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS (ADR) OVERVIEW

### **What are ADRs?**
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project's development. They provide context, reasoning, and consequences for future developers and stakeholders.

### **Why Use ADRs?**
- **Historical context**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Knowledge preservation**: Retain institutional knowledge  
- **Decision reversal**: Provide basis for changing decisions later
- **Team alignment**: Ensure everyone understands architectural choices
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand system design
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for decision documentation

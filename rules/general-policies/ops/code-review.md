# Universal Code Review Standards

This document establishes universal code review processes, quality gates, and collaboration practices that must be followed across all software development projects. These standards provide the foundation for consistent, high-quality code reviews regardless of project specifics.

## 📦 Pull Request Guidance (Scope & Size)

- Keep PRs feature-scoped and under ~400 lines changed where possible.
- Include what/why, before/after, risks, and follow-ups.
- Update headers and READMEs.
- Link ADMs/ADRs when decisions change architecture.

## 🔍 FUNDAMENTAL CODE REVIEW PROCESS

### 1. **Review Process Framework (MANDATORY)**

#### **Core Review Requirements:**
- **Universal coverage**: Every code change must be reviewed before merge
- **Reviewer qualifications**: At least 1 qualified reviewer for standard changes
- **Complexity scaling**: 2+ reviewers for major features or architectural changes
- **Domain expertise**: Security/performance experts required for sensitive changes
- **Review completeness**: All feedback must be addressed before approval

#### **Standard Review Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create PR] --> B[Automated Checks]
    B --> C[Code Review]
    C --> D{Review Pass?}
    D -->|No| E[Request Changes]
    E --> F[Address Feedback]
    F --> C
    D -->|Yes| G[Approve]
    G --> H[Merge]
```

#### **Review Timeline Standards:**
- **Critical changes**: 24 hours maximum
- **Standard changes**: 48 hours maximum
- **Complex changes**: 72 hours maximum with interim feedback
- **Documentation updates**: 24 hours maximum

### 2. **Automated Quality Gates (CRITICAL)**

## 📚 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### **Getting Started with Universal Review Standards:**
1. **Assessment phase**: Evaluate current review practices against these standards
2. **Gap analysis**: Identify areas requiring improvement or implementation
3. **Pilot implementation**: Start with critical components and gradually expand
4. **Team training**: Ensure all team members understand and can apply standards
5. **Tool configuration**: Configure automated tools to support these standards
6. **Metrics establishment**: Implement tracking for key review metrics
7. **Continuous refinement**: Regular review and refinement of implementation

### **Customization for Project-Specific Needs:**
While these universal standards provide the foundation, projects should:
- **Add domain-specific checklists**: Include project-specific review requirements
- **Define specialized approval criteria**: Add project-specific approval requirements
- **Establish domain expert networks**: Identify and involve relevant domain experts
- **Customize automation rules**: Configure project-specific automated checks
- **Adapt communication standards**: Align with project team communication preferences

**Note**: These universal standards serve as the comprehensive foundation for all code review activities, ensuring consistency, quality, and professional excellence across all software development projects. Project-specific requirements should extend (not replace) these foundational standards.

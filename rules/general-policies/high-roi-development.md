# High ROI Development Standards

## 🎯 Purpose
Maximize user impact while minimizing code changes through strategic development approach.

## 📊 ROI Formula & Strategy

### Core Calculation
```markdown
ROI Score = (User Impact × Usage Frequency) / Lines of Code

High ROI (>10):   🚀 Immediate priority
Medium ROI (3-10): ✅ Schedule soon  
Low ROI (<3):     ⏳ Consider deferring

Examples:
- Login fix: Critical impact, daily use, 5 LoC = ROI: 20
- Dashboard widget: High impact, frequent use, 50 LoC = ROI: 8
- Admin feature: Medium impact, rare use, 100 LoC = ROI: 2
- Edge case: Low impact, never use, 20 LoC = ROI: 0.5
```

### Impact Scoring Matrix
```markdown
IMPACT LEVELS:
Critical (10): App breaks without it
High (7-9):    Core user workflows
Medium (4-6):  Nice-to-have features
Low (1-3):     Edge cases, polish
None (0):      Over-engineering
```

### Usage Frequency Scoring
```markdown
FREQUENCY LEVELS:
Always (10):   Every user, every session
Daily (7-9):   Most users, daily
Weekly (4-6):  Regular users, weekly
Monthly (1-3): Some users, monthly
Never (0):     Admin-only, rare events
```

## 🔄 Development Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule Applied
```markdown
FOCUS BREAKDOWN:
80% effort → 20% features (highest ROI)
20% effort → 80% features (lower ROI)

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
- Build core user flows first
- Polish later, if at all
- Question every "nice-to-have"
- Defer complex edge cases
```

### Code Change Hierarchy
```markdown
PREFERRED APPROACH (in order):
1. 🔄 REUSE: Use existing components (0 LoC)
2. 📝 EXTEND: Add props/parameters (5-10 LoC)
3. 🔧 MODIFY: Small changes to existing (10-30 LoC)
4. 🆕 CREATE: Build new (only when necessary)

TARGET DISTRIBUTION:
- 60% Reuse existing code
- 25% Extend/modify existing
- 15% Create new components
```

### Feature Development Priority
```markdown
P0 - MUST HAVE (Do first):
- User authentication
- Core business logic
- Data creation/editing
- Critical user flows

P1 - SHOULD HAVE (Do next):
- Search and filtering
- User preferences
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling

P2 - COULD HAVE (Do later):
- Advanced features
- Admin panels
- Reporting tools
- Integration features

P3 - WON'T HAVE (Skip):
- Edge case handling
- Premature optimizations
- Over-engineered solutions
- "Future-proofing"
```

## 🎯 Implementation Guidelines

### Before Writing Code
```markdown
ASK THESE QUESTIONS:
1. What's the minimum viable implementation?
2. Can I reuse existing components?
3. What's the user's actual need vs. want?
4. Will this be used frequently?
5. Can I solve 80% with 20% effort?

RED FLAGS:
❌ "Let's make it configurable"
❌ "We might need this later"
❌ "Let's handle all edge cases"
❌ "This should be more flexible"
❌ "Users might want to..."

GREEN FLAGS:
✅ "Users need this daily"
✅ "This fixes a blocking issue"
✅ "Reuses existing pattern"
✅ "5 lines solve the problem"
✅ "Critical user workflow"
```

### Code Reuse Strategies

#### Component Reuse
```markdown
BEFORE CREATING NEW:
1. Search for similar components
2. Check if existing can be extended
3. Look for reusable patterns
4. Consider composition over creation

REUSE CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Searched codebase for similar UI
- [ ] Checked existing hooks/utilities
- [ ] Looked at component library
- [ ] Considered prop extensions
- [ ] Evaluated composition approach
```

#### Logic Reuse
```markdown
COMMON REUSABLE PATTERNS:
- API calls (custom hooks)
- Form validation (shared validators)
- State management (context/stores)
- Error handling (error boundaries)
- Loading states (loading components)

EXAMPLE REUSE:
Instead of: New auth form component
Reuse: Existing form + auth hook
Result: 10 LoC vs 200 LoC
```

### Minimal Viable Implementation
```markdown
START WITH SKELETON:
1. Basic HTML structure
2. Core functionality only
3. Minimal styling
4. Essential error handling
5. Basic validation

THEN ADD ONLY IF NEEDED:
- Advanced validation
- Complex styling
- Edge case handling
- Performance optimizations
- Feature enhancements
```

## 🔍 Feature Analysis Framework

### User Story Validation
```markdown
GOOD USER STORY:
"As a [frequent user], I need [core functionality] so I can [achieve primary goal]"

Example: "As a farmer, I need to see tank levels so I can prevent overflows"
→ High ROI: Critical need, daily use, simple display

BAD USER STORY:
"As a [edge user], I might want [complex feature] so I can [minor convenience]"

Example: "As an admin, I might want custom dashboard layouts so I can personalize my view"
→ Low ROI: Rare need, complex implementation, minor benefit
```

### Feature Scope Questions
```markdown
SCOPE REDUCTION CHECKLIST:
1. What's the absolute minimum that solves the problem?
2. Can this be solved with existing UI patterns?
3. What happens if we skip the "nice-to-haves"?
4. Is there a simpler user workflow?
5. Can we defer advanced features?

SCOPE CREEP INDICATORS:
- "It would be cool if..."
- "Users might also want..."
- "While we're at it..."
- "This should be flexible..."
- "Let's make it enterprise-ready..."
```

## ⚡ Implementation Patterns

## 🎯 Decision Making Framework

### Feature Request Evaluation
```markdown
WHEN REQUEST COMES IN:
1. What problem does this solve?
2. How often will it be used?
3. What's the simplest solution?
4. Can we reuse existing code?
5. What's the ROI score?

DECISION MATRIX:
High Impact + Low Effort = Do immediately
High Impact + High Effort = Break into phases
Low Impact + Low Effort = Do if time permits
Low Impact + High Effort = Decline politely
```

### Trade-off Analysis
```markdown
ALWAYS CONSIDER:
- User need vs. developer want
- Simple vs. flexible
- Fast delivery vs. perfect solution
- Core functionality vs. edge cases
- Maintenance cost vs. feature richness

CHOOSE SIMPLE WHEN:
- User need is clear and focused
- Time/resources are limited
- Maintenance is a concern
- Team expertise is limited
- User base is small/focused
```

### Code Review ROI Check
```markdown
ROI CODE REVIEW QUESTIONS:
1. Is this the simplest solution?
2. What existing code could be reused?
3. Will this be used frequently?
4. What's the maintenance cost?
5. Could we achieve 80% benefit with 20% code?
```

## 📚 Quick Reference

```markdown

## 🎯 Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good

The goal is to deliver maximum user value with minimum code complexity. Always choose the simple solution that solves 80% of the problem rather than the complex solution that handles 100% of edge cases.

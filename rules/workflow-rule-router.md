# üöÄ CLAUDE SMART RULE ROUTER v2

**Note**: This router manages ALL rule files in the project. Rules are loaded dynamically based on task keywords rather than all being listed in CLAUDE.md.

## üõë MANDATORY READING ORDER
1. **workflow-before-starting.md** - Breaks your helpful instinct (200 tokens)
2. **workflow-plan-template.md** - Shows exact format (300 tokens)  
3. **This file** - Tells you which rules to load (500 tokens)

## üìä SELF-ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK
Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] I read workflow-before-starting.md
- [ ] I read workflow-plan-template.md
- [ ] I will create a plan before ANY action
- [ ] I will wait for approval

If any unchecked ‚Üí STOP and start over

## üß† SMART LOADING ALGORITHM

The router automatically:
1. **Starts with** foundation rules (always loaded)
2. **Scans** user message for keywords
3. **Adds** relevant rule sets based on matches
4. **Removes** duplicates
5. **Loads** minimal set needed for the task

## üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES
Each violation gets logged:
```
VIOLATION LOG:
- Skipped plan: ‚ùå [timestamp]
- Started coding first: ‚ùå [timestamp]
- Ignored approval: ‚ùå [timestamp]
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS
Track your compliance:
```
SUCCESS LOG:
- Created plan first: ‚úÖ [timestamp]
- Waited for approval: ‚úÖ [timestamp]
- Loaded correct rules: ‚úÖ [timestamp]
```

## üí° QUICK REFERENCE
- Plan format location: `workflow-plan-template.md`
- Testing requirements: `general-policies/testing/core-standards.md`
- Project overview: `current-code/overview.md`
- All rules directory: `.cursor/rules/`

Remember: Load ONLY what's needed - Being efficient means loading the RIGHT rules, not ALL rules
